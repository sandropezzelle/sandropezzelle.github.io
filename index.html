<h2>Research lines</h2>
Some topics I am interested in (contact me for theses and collaborations!)   

<ul>

<li><b>Computational semantics and pragmatics:</b> how Large Language Models represent words, phrases, and sentences (in context)</li>
<li><b>Language and vision:</b> reasoning, linguistic, and communicative abilities of visually-grounded LLMs</li> 
<li><b>Cognitive mechanisms in human semantics:</b> how speakers acquire, use, and adapt their mental representations</li>  
<li><b>Interlocutor-aware text generation:</b> can LLMs tune their style or knowledge to that of an interlocutor?</li>
<li><b>Behavioral and mechanistic interpretability</b>: what are the abilities of LLMs and where/how they occur in the computational graph</li>
</ul>
