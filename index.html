<!--
<p><b>Postdoctoral researcher</b> at ILLC, <a href="https://www.illc.uva.nl/" target="_blank">Institute for Logic, Language, and Computation</a>, <a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/home" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam</a>. My focus is on <b>multimodal, cognitively-inspired computational models of language</b>. As such, my work is at the intersection between Computational Linguistics, Computer Vision and Cognitive Science. I'm part of the <b>DREAM</b> (Distributed dynamic REpresentations for diAlogue Management) ERC project and proud member of the <a href="https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/" target="_blank">Dialogue Modelling Group</a> led by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/" target="_blank">Raquel Fernández</a>.</p>

<p><b>Assistant Professor in Responsible AI</b> at ILLC, Faculty of Science of the <a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/home" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam</a>. My work is at the intersection between Natural Language Processing, AI and Cognitive Science.</p>

<p>Before, I was a Postdoc within the <b>DREAM</b> (Distributed dynamic REpresentations for diAlogue Management) ERC project and member of the <a href="https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/" target="_blank">Dialogue Modelling Group</a> led by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/" target="_blank">Raquel Fernández</a>.</p>

<p>In 2018, I obtained a PhD in Cognitive and Brain Sciences, track <b>Language, Interaction and Computation</b>, at <a href="http://www.cimec.unitn.it/" target="_blank">CIMeC, University of Trento</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/" target="_blank">Raffaella Bernardi</a>. During my PhD, I focused on the learning of <b>quantity expressions</b> from their use in multimodal contexts (see <a href="https://quantit-clic.github.io/" target="_blank">QUANTIT-CLIC</a>). I was intern at <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/research.html" target="_blank">SAP AI Research</a>.

<p>In 2021, I'm Program co-Chair of <a href="https://www.eurnlp.org/eurnlp-2020" target="_blank">EurNLP</a>, co-Organizer of <a href="https://www.lantern.uni-saarland.de/2021/" target="_blank">LANTERN</a> at EACL and co-Editor of a <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/18532/identifying-analyzing-and-overcoming-challenges-in-vision-and-language-research#overview" target="_blank">Frontiers Special Issue on Language and Vision</a>.

<p>In 2021, I'm Program co-Chair of <a href="" target="_blank">EurNLP</a>, co-Organizer of <a href="" target="_blank">LANTERN</a>, and member of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the Cognitive Science Society.


My current research - at the intersection between Computational Linguistics, Computer Vision and Cognitive Science - is focused on the learning of <b>quantity expressions</b> (numbers, proportions, quantifiers). I'm a proud member of <a href="https://quantit-clic.github.io/" target="_blank">QUANTIT-CLIC</a>. I’d define myself as an enthusiastic and proactive person. "Let's try!" is my personal motto.
