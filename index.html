<h2>Research lines</h2>
Some topics I am currently working on (contact me for thesis projects and collaborations!)

<ul>

<li><b>Understanding and narration of visual events:</b> How good are current VLMs at understanding and narrating visual events, and how can we evaluate these skills? Can we improve narration abilities by leveraging human behavioral and cognitive patterns?</li>
<li><b>Ambiguous, underspecified, and implicit language:</b> How do LLMs and VLMs deal with ambiguous (~multiple interpretations), underspecified (~missing information), and implicit (~implying or presupposing a message) language? Can we boost models’ semantic and pragmatic understanding using insights from linguistics?</li>
<li><b>Human-inspired mechanistic interpretability:</b> What are the computational LLM/VLM subgraphs (circuits) responsible for a certain specific behavior? Do they mirror the cognitive and neural mechanisms observed in humans?</li>
<li><b>Benchmarking and evaluation:</b> Can we use LLMs in real communicative and collaborative contexts?</li> 

</ul>

Some topics I am interested in (contact me for theses and collaborations!)   

<ul>

<li><b>Computational semantics and pragmatics:</b> how Large Language Models represent words, phrases, and sentences (in context)</li>
<li><b>Language and vision:</b> reasoning, linguistic, and communicative abilities of visually-grounded LLMs</li> 
<li><b>Cognitive mechanisms in human semantics:</b> how speakers acquire, use, and adapt their mental representations</li>  
<li><b>Interlocutor-aware text generation:</b> can LLMs tune their style or knowledge to that of an interlocutor?</li>
<li><b>Behavioral and mechanistic interpretability</b>: what are the abilities of LLMs and where/how they occur in the computational graph</li>
</ul>



During my PhD, I focused on the learning of <b>quantity expressions</b> from their use in multimodal contexts (see <a href="https://quantit-clic.github.io/" target="_blank">QUANTIT-CLIC</a>). I was intern at <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/research.html" target="_blank">SAP AI Research</a>.

My current research - at the intersection between Computational Linguistics, Computer Vision and Cognitive Science - is focused on the learning of <b>quantity expressions</b> (numbers, proportions, quantifiers).
