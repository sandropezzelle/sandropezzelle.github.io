My focus is on <b>multimodal, cognitively-inspired models of language understanding and generation</b>. As such, my work is at the intersection between Computational Linguistics, Computer Vision, and Cognitive Science. I'm part of the <b>DREAM</b> (Distributed dynamic REpresentations for diAlogue Management) ERC project and a proud member of the <a href="https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/" target="_blank">Dialogue Modelling Group</a> led by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/" target="_blank">Raquel Fernández</a>.</p>

<p><b>Assistant Professor in Responsible AI</b> at the ILLC, Faculty of Science, <a href="http://www.uva.nl/en/home" target="_blank">University of Amsterdam</a>. Affiliated with the <a href="https://dmg-illc.github.io/dmg/" target="_blank">Dialogue Modelling Group</a>.
My research combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision, and Cognitive Science (see my current <b>Research lines</b> below). I published in <b>ACL, EACL, EMNLP, NAACL, TACL, Cognition,</b> and <b>Cognitive Science</b>.</p>

<p>Before, I was a Postdoc within the <b>DREAM</b> (Distributed dynamic REpresentations for diAlogue Management) ERC project led by <a href="https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/r.fernandezrovira/" target="_blank">Raquel Fernández</a>. And, before, a PhD candidate at <a href="http://www.cimec.unitn.it/" target="_blank">CIMeC, University of Trento</a>, under the supervision of <a href="http://disi.unitn.it/~bernardi/" target="_blank">Raffaella Bernardi</a>
(check <a href="https://quantit-clic.github.io/" target="_blank">QUANTIT-CLIC</a> for some of my PhD work). In 2018, I was research intern at <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/research.html" target="_blank">SAP AI Research</a>.</p>

<p>I am a <a href="https://ellis.eu/members" target="_blank">member of the ELLIS society</a>, a <a href="https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/ellis/people/" target="_blank">faculty member of the ELLIS Amsterdam Unit</a>, and a <a href="https://www.sigsem.org/wiki/index.php?title=Contact" target="_blank">board member of SigSem</a>, the ACL special interest group in computational semantics.

<h2>Research lines</h2>
Some topics I am interested in (contact me for theses and collaborations!)   

<ul>

<li><b>Computational semantics and pragmatics:</b> how NLP models represent words, phrases, and sentences (in context)</li>
<li><b>Language and vision:</b> reasoning, linguistic, and communicative abilities of visually-grounded models</li> 
<li><b>Cognitive mechanisms in human semantics:</b> how speakers acquire, use, and adapt their mental representations</li>  
<li><b>Interlocutor-aware text generation:</b> can NLG models tune their style or knowledge to that of an interlocutor?</li>
<li><b>Model interpretability</b>: how and where large language models store their knowledge and skills</li>
</ul>

During my PhD, I focused on the learning of <b>quantity expressions</b> from their use in multimodal contexts (see <a href="https://quantit-clic.github.io/" target="_blank">QUANTIT-CLIC</a>). I was intern at <a href="https://www.sap.com/products/artificial-intelligence/research.html" target="_blank">SAP AI Research</a>.

My current research - at the intersection between Computational Linguistics, Computer Vision and Cognitive Science - is focused on the learning of <b>quantity expressions</b> (numbers, proportions, quantifiers). I'm a proud member of <a href="https://quantit-clic.github.io/" target="_blank">QUANTIT-CLIC</a>. I’d define myself as an enthusiastic and proactive person. "Let's try!" is my personal motto.
